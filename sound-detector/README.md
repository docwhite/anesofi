# Sound Detector

Live recording the microphone with [pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)
feeding it to a TensorFlow YAMNet retrained model.

I used transfer learning on the [YAMNet model](https://tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1) that
has been trained on the [AudioSet data](https://research.google.com/audioset/) to narrow
it down to my particular case of high heel detection.

To run the Jupyter Notebook you will need the pip `notebook` package installed, then:

```
jupyter notebook transfer_learning.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

This Python project uses the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) packaging and
dependency management tool.

In my case my LSP of my editor won't pick up the dependencies because `poetry`
encapsulates them.

You can either run a `poetry shell` and open the text editor or install them with pip
on your python installation (`pyenv` in my case). You can also run a Python console
with `poetry run python`.

First make sure Python is compliant with the python version specified in `pyproject.toml`:

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11,<3.12"
```

If it's not the case use pyenv to install the right version.

Follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation):

```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# Then add the following in the ~/.bashrc
#
#   export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
#   [[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
#   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
#   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
#
```

Then you can install and set the correct Python version:

```
# If on the Raspberry Pi install development OpenSSL libraries before building Python
#
#   https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki/Common-build-problems#error-the-python-ssl-extension-was-not-compiled-missing-the-openssl-lib
#
sudo apt install libssl-dev

pyenv install 3.11.5
```

Now activate the installation:

```
# Remember to revert to the system-installed Python afterwards `pyenv global system`.
pyenv global 3.11.5 
```

Install the system libraries that will be needed for building the python packages:

```
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
```

Then you can proceed to install poetry, the package management tool that is more aware
of the dependency resolution. Follow the [official instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation):

```
pip install --upgrade pip \
 && pip install --upgrade keyrings.alt \ # TODO: Needed?
 && pip install poetry \
 && poetry config virtualenvs.create false \
 && poetry install --no-interaction
```

Now to install the dependencies on Raspberry Pi:

```
# Avoid hanging by disabling the keyring backend.
#
#   https://stackoverflow.com/a/60804443
#
export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
poetry install
```
